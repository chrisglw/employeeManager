# Overview
As a software engineer, my goal in developing this project was to enhance my understanding of the C# programming language. 
The software serves as a basic Employee Management System, demonstrating key concepts and syntax within C#.

The purpose of this project is to create a functional console application that manages employee information. 
By implementing features such as adding, editing, and displaying employee details, 
I aimed to solidify my knowledge of C# fundamentals, including object-oriented programming principles.
